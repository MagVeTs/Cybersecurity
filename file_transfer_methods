Transfering files (including executables) between devices by turning one device into a simple web server using python (and executing them); written for Linux (Windows will be a bit different in some things):

1) turn device that has file on it into a web server by going to the directory where file resides and opening terminal
2) command:
python -m http.server <PORT, e.g. 9000>
now this device is a server
3) On the device that you wish to download the file to (i.e. the client), open terminal in directory you want file to download to
4) command:
wget http://<IP_of_SERVER>:<SERVER_PORT, e.g. 9000>/<FILE_NAME>
5) allow execution the file, command:
chmod a+x <FILE_NAME>
6)execute the file from the directory it is in, command:
./<FILE_NAME>
