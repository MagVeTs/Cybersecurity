1)
AWS provides a URL that is publicly accessible with the contents of each bucket (buckets can, of course, be made non-public).

Public S3 buckets naming conventions:

http://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key (for a bucket created in the US East (N. Virginia) region)
https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
http://s3-region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
https://s3-region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
http://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
https://s3.region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
http://s3.dualstack.region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key (for requests using IPv4 or IPv6)
https://s3.dualstack.region.amazonaws.com/bucket/key
http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/key
http://bucket.s3-region.amazonaws.com/key
http://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/key
http://bucket.s3.dualstack.region.amazonaws.com/key (for requests using IPv4 or IPv6)
http://bucket.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com/key (if static website hosting is enabled on the bucket)
http://bucket.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/key (where the filetransfer exits Amazon's network at the last possible moment so as to give the fastest possible transfer speed and lowest latency)
http://bucket.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/key
http://bucket/key (where bucket is a DNS CNAME record pointing to bucket.s3.amazonaws.com)
https://access_point_name-account ID.s3-accesspoint.region.amazonaws.com (for requests via an access point granting restricted access to a bucket)

Companies often use the following naming conventions for S3 buckets:

assets.{domain_name}.com.s3.amazonaws.com/

{org_name}-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/

org: bestcloudcompany site: s3.amazonaws.com
