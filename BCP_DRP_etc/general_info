Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Introduction
A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a strategic document outlining the procedures for an organization to recover from disruptive incidents and restore normal operations. Its primary function is to ensure the continued delivery of critical services during and after an event.

BCP Invocation
The decision to invoke a BCP is typically based on the severity of an incident.  While the primary focus should be on containing the incident, a BCP can provide a framework for expediting recovery efforts.  The BCP may authorize the bypassing of certain standard procedures, such as extensive change approval processes, to facilitate a faster response. However, this authorization is often limited to senior management due to the potential consequences of bypassing established controls.

Following successful incident containment, the BCP guides the organization through a structured recovery process, aiming to return to a state of "Business As Usual" (BAU).  The decision to invoke a BCP is not automatic; its application is reserved for significant incidents exceeding a predefined severity threshold.

BCP vs. DRP
The BCP holds similarities to a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP). However, the BCP has a broader scope, encompassing technical recovery (addressed in the DRP) alongside communication strategies for internal and external stakeholders. In essence, the DRP often serves as a sub-component of the overarching BCP.

BCP Development
The following steps provide a framework for creating an effective BCP:

Business Impact Analysis (BIA): This analysis identifies potential incident scenarios and their corresponding impacts on the organization and its customers.  The BIA employs both qualitative and quantitative assessment methods.

Recovery Actions: Based on the BIA findings, potential recovery actions are defined.  These actions may include switching to a disaster recovery system in the event of a production server outage.  Documenting these actions facilitates a more rapid response during actual incidents.

BCP Team Structure:  The BCP assigns specific roles and responsibilities to team members, including documentation of actions and stakeholder communication. This structure should be clearly documented and communicated to all relevant personnel.

BCP Testing:  Regular testing through tabletop exercises is crucial to ensure the BCP's effectiveness.  These exercises allow team members to practice their roles and identify areas for improvement.

BCP Metrics
The BIA incorporates quantitative metrics to assess recovery timelines and their acceptability.  Key metrics include:

Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The acceptable amount of data loss. For example, an RPO of one hour necessitates hourly backups.
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The targeted timeframe for hardware recovery.
Work Recovery Time (WRT): The targeted timeframe for software and data recovery.
Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD): The maximum downtime threshold; the combined RTO and WRT must fall within this limit.
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): The average time interval between system failures.
Mean Time To Repair (MTTR): The average time required to restore system functionality.
