Metagoofil
https://github.com/opsdisk/metagoofil
https://www.kali.org/tools/metagoofil/
https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/metagoofil
* Linux based; search through documents on a target's website; retrieve metadata; uses Python; can be used on all OSs not just Linux
* Not installed by default on Kali Linux; type metagoofil and it will ask if you want to install it
* sample syntax:
$ metagoofil -d udemy.com -t doc,docx,ppt,pptx,pdf -l 50 -n 25 -o udemy_files -f 
# -d = target domain (Metagoofil will automatically search subdomains of the target domain)
# -t = file types to search for
# -l = stop search after X number of files found
# -n = limit number of found files to be downloaded
# -o = create an output directory within the current working directory for all downloaded files to be stored
# -f = put all the results in one html file
NOTE: Google may consider Metagoofil a bot and block it from properly executing; it may be necessary to run Metagoofil through TOR so that the requests for the documents are seen to come from many different IPs and therefore will escape being blocked by Google

the Harvester
* gathers employee names, email addresses, subdomains, hosts, PGP key entries, open ports and service banners from servers
* installed by default on Kali linux; can use Google or other search engines; can search LinkedIn and other social media
* recon-ng is similar but better

recon-ng
* like the Harvester, but better
* really complete, all-in-one tool, for passive reconnaisance/OSINT (in the same way that Metasploit is an all-in-one tool for exploits)
* has all kinds of modules that allow it to be used for many types of OSINT searches
* Python based' cross-platform compatabile
* installed on Kali Linux by default
* syntax:
$ recon-ng
# starts recon-ng
$ recon-ng -w <NAME_OF_WORKSPACE>
# starts and creates a workspace to store all your OSINT on a particular target
