"GHunt (v2) is an offensive Google framework, designed to evolve efficiently.
It's currently focused on OSINT, but any use related with Google is possible.
Features :
CLI usage and modules
Python library usage
Fully async
JSON export
Browser extension to ease login"

theHarvester
* gathers employee names, email addresses, subdomains, hosts, PGP key entries, open ports and service banners from servers
* installed by default on Kali linux; can use Google or other search engines; can search LinkedIn and other social media
* recon-ng is similar but better
* syntax:
$ theHarvester
# starts theHarvester
$ theHarvester -d udemy.com -l 5 -b google
# -d = target domain (subdomains are automatically included)
# -l = limit search results to a chosen number
# -b = search engine to use for the search
NOTE: Google may consider theHarvester a bot and block it from properly executing; it may be necessary to run theHarvester through TOR so that the requests for the documents are seen to come from many different IPs and therefore will escape being blocked by Google

recon-ng
- https://www.kali.org/tools/recon-ng/
- https://hackertarget.com/recon-ng-tutorial/
* like the Harvester, but better
* really complete, all-in-one tool, for passive reconnaisance/OSINT (in the same way that Metasploit is an all-in-one tool for exploits)
* has all kinds of modules that allow it to be used for many types of OSINT searches
* Python based' cross-platform compatabile
* installed on Kali Linux by default
* by default no modules are loaded in recon-ng; you must install modules to use (see below)
* NOTE: big change in recon-ng syntax between version 4 and version 5; online guides and tutorials for a different version than is being used will not be helpful
* syntax:
$ recon-ng
# starts recon-ng; prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][default] > `

$ recon-ng -w <NAME_OF_WORKSPACE>
# starts within a workspace that you have already created to store all your OSINT on a particular target; ; the prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][WORKSPACE_NAME] > `

[recon-ng] > help
# displays list of commands; choose a command about which you wish to learn more and enter it - info will be displayed

[recon-ng][default] > workspaces create <WORKSPACE_NAME, e.g. tesla>
# creates workspace

[recon-ng][default] > workspaces list
# list available workspaces

[recon-ng][default] > workspaces load <WORKSPACE_NAME>
# load a particular workspace; the prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][WORKSPACE_NAME] > `

[recon-ng][default] > modules search
# list modules already installed

[recon-ng][default] > marketplace search
# list all the modules available for installation

[recon-ng][default] > marketplace install all
# installs all modules (the ones that do not yet have API keys installed will generate error messages stating that)

[recon-ng][default] > marketplace install recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
# installs a particular module (in this case the module is "recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs"
# NOTE: some modules will require API key to use; for example in order to use the module that searches Twitter you first need to register with Twitter and request an API key (see here:
# https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api); then you can plug the API key into the associated module and use it

[recon-ng][tesla] > marketplace load whois_pocs
# loads a particular module; the prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > `

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > info
# display info re the current module

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > db schema
# shows available fields in the database that can be populated with data

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > db insert domains
# chooses the "domains" field as the field that will be receiving data; the target domains will be input into this field
# a prompt will appear for the data: `domain (TEXT): `
# you can add multiple domains but you have to issue the `db insert domains` for each one 

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > show domains
# see a list of domains in the db
