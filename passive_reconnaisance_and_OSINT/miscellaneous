[Tip] Gmail: how to find the person name behind every gmail address, without notifying the target:
-create a google documents
-share the documents with the gmail account of the target
-untick the "Notify people" box
-...and the name is disclosed
Just don't forget to unshare the document after disclosing the name. This trick works with all gmail account without notifying the target ... [just be careful that] after the name has been disclosed you should directly delete the access of the target to the document. It's highly unprobable that the target will notice during this 5-10 second timeframe the presence of this new document.
[This trick will also work for non-gmail email addresses provided they are associated with a gmail account.]
To be honest, there are alredy at least two tools that can extract this and additional information about gmail account: Ghunt [https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt] and http://Epieos.com. Here the idea was just to find a new and easy manual way to perform this task without [being] tool dependent
