URL Shorteners
----------------
"Attackers usually hide the malicious domains under URL Shorteners. A URL Shortener is a tool that creates a short and unique URL that will redirect to the specific website specified during the initial step of setting up the URL Shortener link. According to Cofense, attackers use the following URL Shortening services to generate malicious links: 

bit.ly
goo.gl
ow.ly
s.id
smarturl.it
tiny.pl
tinyurl.com
x.co
You can see the actual website the shortened link is redirecting you to by appending "+" to it ... Type the shortened URL in the address bar of the web browser and add the above characters to see the redirect URL." -- https://tryhackme.com/room/pyramidofpainax (Task 4)
