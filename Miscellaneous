https://planetcalc.com/1721/
"Levenshtein distance (or edit distance) between two strings is the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform source string into target string."
Basically, it is the measure of the similarity between two strings - the lower the number the more similar.

https://planetcalc.com/2476/
"This online calculator computes Shannon entropy for a given event probability table and for a given message."
Basically, it tells you how likely an event is to be random vs. deliberate. It can tell you how likely a given string was arranged randomly vs. deliberately - it does this by calculating symbol frequency.

URL Shorteners
----------------
"Attackers usually hide the malicious domains under URL Shorteners. A URL Shortener is a tool that creates a short and unique URL that will redirect to the specific website specified during the initial step of setting up the URL Shortener link. According to Cofense, attackers use the following URL Shortening services to generate malicious links: 

bit.ly
goo.gl
ow.ly
s.id
smarturl.it
tiny.pl
tinyurl.com
x.co
You can see the actual website the shortened link is redirecting you to by appending "+" to it ... Type the shortened URL in the address bar of the web browser and add the above characters to see the redirect URL." -- https://tryhackme.com/room/pyramidofpainax (Task 4)
