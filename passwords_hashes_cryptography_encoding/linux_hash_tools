Tools for encrypting and decrypting and hashing
------------------------------------------------

* GNU_Privacy_Guard - see: tools/GNU_Privacy_Guard in this repository
* OpenSSL - see: tools/OpenSSL in this repository


* Checking hashes in Linux Terminal [from: https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop102021 ; task 18]
$ md5sum <NAME_OF_FILE>
$ sha1sum <NAME_OF_FILE>
$ sha256sum <NAME_OF_FILE>

* Another type of hashing option is supplied by HMAC (Hash-based message authentication code). This method combines the hashing function with a secret key. The same file will receive different hashes depending on the key that is chosen. One must know the secret key in order to check the hash (checksum) of the file you are examining against the hash of the original file in ordr to confirm there has been no tampering.
The following Linux tools can be used for HMAC: 
- hmac256
- sha224hmac
- sha256hmac
- sha384hmac
- sha512hmac
Example syntax:
$ hmac256 s!Kr37 message.txt
$ sha256hmac message.txt --key s!Kr37

Tools for Encoding and Decoding
----------------------
To encode in the terminal:
$ echo "TEXT" | base64
# output will be in base64 encoding

Tools for Identifying Hashes
------------------------------
* hashid
see: MagVeTs/Cybersecurity/tools/hashid
*hash-identifier
see: MagVeTs/Cybersecurity/tools/hash-identifier
also see: https://medium.com/infosec-adventures/identifying-and-cracking-hashes-7d580b9fd7f1 where these tools are discussed and it says that hash-id has more functionality; it can give you hashcat mode code and john the ripper format

Tools for Cracking Passwords and Hashes
---------------------------------------
* hashcat

* john the ripper
