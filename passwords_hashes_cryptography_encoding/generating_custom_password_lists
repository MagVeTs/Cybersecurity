How to prep password lists for use by combining multiple lists and removing duplicates:
> cat list1.txt list2.txt list3.txt > aggregated_list.txt
> sort aggregated_list.txt | uniq -u > deduplicated_aggregated_list.txt
[hat tip: https://tryhackme.com/room/passwordattacks - Task 3]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is worthwhile to create a custom list for a company. The cewl tool will crawl and scrape a company's website and pull strings that fit certain criteria and generate a wordlist for brute forcing based on those strings.
example syntax:
> cewl -w list.txt -d 5 -m 5 http://thm.labs
`-w` - output file
`-d` - minimum string length
`-m` - webcrawling/spidering depth level (2 is default)
`http://thm.labs` - url to search
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Employ the tool `username_generator` to create a list of possible usernames to brutefore. One supplies employee names and `username_generator` produces a list that combines them in many different ways.
example: John Smith, becomes:
johnsmith
smithjohn
jsmith
josmith
smithj
john_smith
smith_john
etc.
syntax:
> git clone https://github.com/therodri2/username_generator.git
> cd username_generator
> python3 username_generator.py -h [shows help message and arguments]
> echo "John Smith" > users.txt
> python3 username_generator.py -w users.txt

Crunch
------
Employ the tool `crunch` to generate all possible random combinations of designated letters/numbers/symbols in order to use them in a brute force attack:
syntax:
crunch -h 
help screen

crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o crunch.txt
generates "words" of minimum 2 characters and maximum 2 characters using all possible combinations of the following numbers/letters: 01234abcd Output is written to crunch.txt file.

crunch also lets us specify a character set using the -t option to combine words of our choice. Here are some of the other options that could be used to help create different combinations of your choice:

@ - lower case alpha characters

, - upper case alpha characters

% - numeric characters

^ - special characters including space
For example, if part of the password is known to us, and we know it starts with pass and is followed by two numbers, we can use the % symbol from above to match the numbers. Here we generate a wordlist that contains "pass" followed by 2 numbers:
crunch 6 6 -t pass%%

CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler
------------------
Python tool for creating custom wordlists to brute force from. The wordlists are created based on information you supply regarding the user. There is a 1337/leet mode option which will replace letters wiyh leetspeak numbers and characters.
The git repository is here: https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.
syntax:
> git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git
change to the CUPP directory and run:
> python3 cupp.py
[add -h for help page]
> python3 cupp.py -i
interactive mode where you fill in info about user; press enter to skip fields you do not know the answer to
> python3 cupp.py -l
see and choose from a list of custom wordlists that can be chosen; e.g. languages (japanese, yiddish, italian) or subjects (literature, music, movieTV)
> python3 cupp.py -a
pull a list of default usernames/passwords from the Alecto database

Difference between brute-force attack and password spray attack:
* brute-force - test many common/predictable passwords against one username
* password spraying - test one common/predictable password against many usernames
Note: password spraying attacks are less likely than brute-force attacks to trigger account lockouts

Common and weak passwords often follow a pattern and format, e.g.

* SeasonYear (e.g. Fall2020)
* MonthYear (e.g. November2020)
* CompanyNameRandomNumbers (e.g. TryHackMe01)
Note: If a password complexity policy is enforced within the organization, we may need to create a password that includes symbols to fulfill the requirement, such as October2021!, Spring2021!, October2021@, etc.
Note: For better success in a password spraying attack, first enumerate the target and gather OSINT to compile a list of valid usernames/email addresses.

Tools for password spraying at various services:
* hydra [sample syntax: hydra -L usernames-list.txt -p Spring2021 ssh://10.1.1.10]
* https://github.com/xFreed0m/RDPassSpray - against RDP [sample syntax: python3 RDPassSpray.py -U usernames-list.txt -p Spring2021! -t 10.100.10.240:3026]
* Metasploit (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login) - against smb
* https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/TREVORspray 
TREVORspray is a modular password sprayer with threading, clever proxying, loot modules, and more!
* https://github.com/knavesec/CredMaster
Launch a password spray / brute force attach via Amazon AWS passthrough proxies, shifting the requesting IP address for every authentication attempt. This dynamically creates FireProx APIs for more evasive password sprays.
* https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper
MailSniper is a penetration testing tool for searching through email in a Microsoft Exchange environment for specific terms (passwords, insider intel, network architecture information, etc.). It can be used as a non-administrative user to search their own email or by an Exchange administrator to search the mailboxes of every user in a domain.
MailSniper also includes additional modules for password spraying, enumerating users and domains, gathering the Global Address List (GAL) from OWA and EWS and checking mailbox permissions for every Exchange user at an organization.
