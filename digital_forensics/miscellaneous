Normal Core Windows Processes appearing in TaskManager:

"A Task Manager provides some of the Core Windows Processes running in the background. Below is a summary of running processes that are considered normal behaviour.

Note: ">" symbol represents a parent-child relationship. System (Parent) > smss.exe (Child)

System
System > smss.exe
csrss.exe
wininit.exe
wininit.exe > services.exe
wininit.exe > services.exe > svchost.exe
lsass.exe
winlogon.exe
explorer.exe

In addition, the processes with no depiction of a parent-child relationship should not have a Parent Process under normal circumstances, except for the System process, which should only have System Idle Process (0) as its parent process." -- TryHackMe [https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoendpointsecurity - Task 2]
