Log Analysis
------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Log Types

"Application Logs: Messages about specific applications, including status, errors, warnings, etc.
Audit Logs: Activities related to operational procedures crucial for regulatory compliance.
Security Logs: Security events such as logins, permissions changes, firewall activity, etc.
Server Logs: Various logs a server generates, including system, event, error, and access logs.
System Logs: Kernel activities, system errors, boot sequences, and hardware status.
Network Logs: Network traffic, connections, and other network-related events.
Database Logs: Activities within a database system, such as queries and updates.
Web Server Logs: Requests processed by a web server, including URLs, response codes, etc."

Log Formats

Structured - easiest to parse
* Field Delimited Formats - Comma-Separated Values (CSV) and Tab-Separated Values (TSV)
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
* eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
* W3C Extended Log Format (ELF) - used by Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) Web Server

Semi-structured - mixture of firmly delimited and "free-form" text
* Syslog Message Format
* Windows Event Log (EVTX) Format

Unstructured - may be difficult to parse and input to other systems
* NCSA Common Log Format (CLF) - default on Apache HTTP servers
* NCSA Combined Log Format (Combined) - adds some more fields to CLF; default on Nginx HTTP Servers

Anomalous Indicators that if found in a log may indicate attack:

--------------------
SQL Injection:

' [single quote]
-- [comment]
# [comment]
UNION [union statement]
WAITFOR DELAY [time based attack]
SLEEP() [time based attack]

NOTE: for more SQL injections, see here: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL%20Injection
NOTE: SQL injections are often found in the q= (query parameter) of the URL
NOTE: payload may be URL-encoded and need to be first decoded in order to be recognized
--------------------
XSS (Cross-site Scripting):

<script> [script tag]
onmouseover [event handler]
onclick [event handler]
onerror [event handler]

NOTE: XSS payload is often inserted into search= (search parameter) in the URL
--------------------
Path Traversal (aka Directory Traversal):

../
../../
etc.
also look for sensitive file paths, e.g. /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow

NOTE: payload may be URL encoded (%2E = . and %2F = /) or double-encoded
NOTE: more directory traversal payloads: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Directory%20Traversal/README.md
