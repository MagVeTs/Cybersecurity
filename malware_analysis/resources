ssdeep - fuzzy hashing program
https://ssdeep-project.github.io/ssdeep/index.html
"ssdeep is a program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH). Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies. Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length...It also provides a library (libfuzzy) to generate/compare fuzzy hashes. ssdeep hashes are now widely used for simple identification purposes."
"Fuzzy hashing is also a strong weapon against the attacker's tools. Fuzzy hashing helps you to perform similarity analysis - match two files with minor differences based on the fuzzy hash values. One of the examples of fuzzy hashing is the usage of SSDeep; on the SSDeep official website, you can also find the complete explanation for fuzzy hashing." --https://tryhackme.com/room/pyramidofpainax ; Task 7
