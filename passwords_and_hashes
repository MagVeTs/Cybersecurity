"CrackStation uses massive pre-computed lookup tables to crack password hashes. These tables store a mapping between the hash of a password, and the correct password for that hash. The hash values are indexed so that it is possible to quickly search the database for a given hash. If the hash is present in the database, the password can be recovered in a fraction of a second. This only works for "unsalted" hashes."

THC Hydra

From: https://tryhackme.com/room/protocolsandservers2 ; task 6 [with some editing]
Hydra supports many protocols, including FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, SSH, and all methods related to HTTP. The general command-line syntax is:
hydra -l USERNAME -P WORDLIST.TXT SERVER SERVICE

where we specify the following options:

-l USERNAME: -l should precede the username, i.e. the login name of the target.
-P WORDLIST.TXT: -P precedes the wordlist.txt file, which is a text file containing the list of passwords you want to try with the provided username, e.g. /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
SERVER is the hostname or IP address of the target server.
SERVICE indicates the service which you are trying to launch the dictionary attack (e.g. ftp or imap)

Consider the following concrete examples:

hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.69.61 ftp will use mark as the username as it iterates over the provided passwords against the FTP server.
hydra -l mark -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.69.61 is identical to the previous example. 10.10.69.61 ftp is the same as ftp://10.10.69.61.
hydra -l frank -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.69.61 ssh will use frank as the user name as it tries to login via SSH using the different passwords.

There are some extra optional arguments that you can add:

-s PORT to specify a non-default port for the service in question.
-V or -vV, for verbose, makes Hydra show the username and password combinations that are being tried. This verbosity is very convenient to see the progress, especially if you are still not confident of your command-line syntax.
-t n where n is the number of parallel connections to the target. -t 16 will create 16 threads used to connect to the target.
-d, for debugging, to get more detailed information about what’s going on. The debugging output can save you much frustration; for instance, if Hydra tries to connect to a closed port and timing out, -d will reveal this right away.
Once the password is found, you can issue CTRL-C to end the process.
