From Heath Adams - The Cyber Mentor (Practical Ethical Hacking: The Complete Course - https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/1152300)

* After nmapping an IP some ports will have services that are "low hanging fruit", meaning that they are running services for which a lot of exploits exist. Others will be running services that are less likely to be easily exploitable. Focus on the "low hanging fruit" first.

http/https (80/443) - have many exploits
smb (445; smb also may use NetBIOS ports: TCP 139, TCP/UDP 137, UDP 138) - has many exploits

ssh (22) - does NOT have many exploits that are likely to grant RCE

* When working on testing http/https one of the first things to do is to visit the IP in a webbrowser.
* If visiting an IP on a webbrowser brings one to a default webpage that is a finding since it reveals info re the architecture and shows that they have open ports that they are not using (it shows poor hygiene to an attacker and encourages them to look further for misconfigurations)
