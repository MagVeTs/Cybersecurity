MCP (Model Context Protocol)
-----------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Information about MCP and how it works:

"MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools...MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure ...

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

- MCP Hosts: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- MCP Clients: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- Local Data Sources: Your computerâ€™s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- Remote Services: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to"

"How MCP Works
At a high level, MCP follows a client-server architecture:

MCP Hosts/Clients: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
MCP Servers: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol
Local Data Sources: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
Remote Services: External systems available over the internet that MCP servers can connect to
The MCP server acts as an intermediary between AI assistants and various services. When users request actions through natural language, the AI interprets these requests and communicates with the MCP server to execute them.

Example: Setting up MCP for Gmail
Let's walk through how a user might set up and use MCP with Gmail:

Setup Phase:
The user installs and configures an MCP server
They authenticate to Gmail through OAuth, generating a token
The MCP server securely stores this OAuth token
The server registers Gmail as an available tool for AI assistants
Usage Flow:
User to AI: "Check if I have any unread emails from my boss about the quarterly report"
AI recognizes this as a Gmail task and formulates a structured query
AI sends the query to the MCP server
MCP server uses the stored OAuth token to access Gmail's API
MCP server searches for matching emails and returns results to the AI
AI presents the findings to the user in natural language
Further Interactions:
User: "Delete all the marketing emails from last week"
AI sends appropriate commands to the MCP server
MCP executes the deletion operation via Gmail's API
This enables powerful workflows where users can manage their email through natural conversations without directly interacting with Gmail's interface."
