A list of useful payloads and bypass for Web Application Security and Pentest/CTF

https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
"SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
This project is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, and g0tmi1k."

GTFOBins
https://gtfobins.github.io/
GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems. The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused to ... break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.
It is important to note that this is not a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOBins is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain binaries available.

LOLBAS
https://lolbas-project.github.io/
Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (and now also Libraries)
Goal
The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.

Criteria
A LOLBin/Lib/Script must:

Be a Microsoft-signed file, either native to the OS or downloaded from Microsoft.
Have extra "unexpected" functionality. It is not interesting to document intended use cases.
Exceptions are application whitelisting bypasses
Have functionality that would be useful to an APT or red team
Interesting functionality can include:

Executing code
Arbitrary code execution
Pass-through execution of other programs (unsigned) or scripts (via a LOLBin)
Compiling code
File operations
Downloading
Upload
Copy
Persistence
Pass-through persistence utilizing existing LOLBin
Persistence (e.g. hide data in ADS, execute at logon)
UAC bypass
Credential theft
Dumping process memory
Surveillance (e.g. keylogger, network trace)
Log evasion/modification
DLL side-loading/hijacking without being relocated elsewhere in the filesystem.
[like GTFOBins but for Windows OS]
