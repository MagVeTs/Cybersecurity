Analyzing email headers for spoofing:

Capturing the email headers:

How to Get Email Headers
"Every single Internet e-mail message is made up of two parts the header and the message body of the email. Every single email you send or receive on the Internet contains an Internet Header, a full and valid e-mail header provides a detailed log of the network path taken by the message between the mail sender and the mail receiver(s) (email servers).
Your email client program will usually hide the full header or display only lines, such as From, To, Date, and Subject, see below for more information on pulling headers for your email client" -- https://mxtoolbox.com

Email Header Analyzer

"This tool will make email headers human readable by parsing them according to RFC 822.  Email headers are present on every email you receive via the Internet and can provide valuable diagnostic information like hop delays, anti-spam results and more."

Paste email message header into this site and it will extract URLs from the text. CyberChef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) has a "Extract URLs" option that does this too.

SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
""Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is used to authenticate the sender of an email. With an SPF record in place, Internet Service Providers can verify that a mail server is authorized to send email for a specific domain. An SPF record is a DNS TXT record containing a list of the IP addresses that are allowed to send email on behalf of your domain." -- https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
"DKIM stands for DomainKeys Identified Mail and is used for the authentication of an email that’s being sent. Like SPF, DKIM is an open standard for email authentication that is used for DMARC alignment. A DKIM record exists in the DNS, but it is a bit more complicated than SPF. DKIM’s advantage is that it can survive forwarding, which makes it superior to SPF and a foundation for securing your email." -- https://dmarcian.com/what-is-dkim/

DMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)
"DMARC, (Domain-based  Message Authentication Reporting, & Conformance) an open source standard, uses a concept called alignment to tie the result of two other open source standards, SPF (a published list of servers that are authorized to send email on behalf of a domain) and DKIM (a tamper-evident domain seal associated with a piece of email), to the content of an email. If not already deployed, putting a DMARC record into place for your domain will give you feedback that will allow you to troubleshoot your SPF and DKIM configurations if needed." -- https://dmarcian.com/getting-started-with-dmarc/

DMARC Domain Health Checker:
"Use our DMARC Domain Checker to find out if an email domain is protected against phishing, spoofing or fraud. Our domain checker offers you quick insights by inspecting DMARC, SPF and DKIM records and shows you if there are any actions you need to take."

S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)

Mail Spoofer (6Point6)
https://github.com/6point6/mail-spoofer
"A proof of concept email spoofing tool built on Docker.
One of the biggest mistakes the cybersecurity industry has made is believing SPF, DKIM, and ARC prevent email contents spoofing.
Mail Spoofer is a Proof-of-Concept email spoofing tool built on Docker. We created it to target domains with missing or misconfigured DMARC records.
The tool reduces the effort of setting up PTR, SPF, DKIM and ARC infrastructure. Our guiding principle is to reduce the complexity of spoofing attacks, educate the cybersecurity industry and force organizations into universally applying DMARC records."

DKIM Records Lookup
For querying DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) we need the selector. It provides a digital signature and encryption key that authenticates email messages.
You need to find out the selector of the domain. If you look at the details of an email sent from google/gmail, you can find out the selector for google. Similarly, you can find other domain selectors. For querying it we have to execute the command as below. In the output, we can view the DKIM signature published in their DNS record.
