# Ping Sweeper

if [ "$1" == "" ]
then
echo "You forgot an IP address!"
echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.1"

else
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done

# ping = send an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packet to the IP address
# -c 1 = amount of packets to be sent
# cut -d " " = extract section of line as delimited by spaces (d = delimiter)
# -f 4 = the section of line that is to be extracted is the section that comes right before the fourth space (f = field)
# tr -d ":" = deletes the ":" (tr = translate; the -d after `tr` says to delete the character(s) that appear in quotation marks)

"Frequently Asked Questions:

Question: My bash script is producing an error with “seq”. How do I resolve?

Resolution: Ensure use of backtick (`) instead of using single quote ('). Alternatively, use $(seq 1 254) instead of seq"
