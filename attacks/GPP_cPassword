- This attack is over a decade old as of 2023 and it has been patched; however in older AD environments it is worth running this attack (using Metasploit) because Metasploit will quickly find and exploit it if it has not been patched or old files created before the patch have not been deleted yet.

syntax:
msf auxiliary(smb_enum_gpp) > run
