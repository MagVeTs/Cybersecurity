* This attack uses the eXtensible Markup Language (XML); see: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp
* TCM recommended repository of XXE injection payloads: https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection
* Not such a common vulnerability anymore, but it is still worth testing for if you find a web app that accepts XML
* Also test for XXEi on API endpoints that accept JSON, because sometimes such endpoints will also accept XML (and these kind of situations are often overlooked and worth checking for on pentests or bug bounties)
