"ANY.RUN vs. Joe Sandbox: Which malware analysis sandbox should you choose?
Of the two solutions, Joe Sandbox is the one to go to if you need to check files for multiple different operating systems and devices, while ANY.RUN covers only Windows systems. Joe Sandbox also offers lets you use real physical machines in addition to virtual machines, which is an awesome feature when it comes to evasive malware that are testing their environment to be sure they donâ€™t run in a sandbox.

Yet ANY.RUN sandbox is a good choice if you need real-time interactions with the environment the suspicious files are run in. This is an invaluable feature for analyzing threats that need some clicking or user interaction before launching their payload."
