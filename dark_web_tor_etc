ðŸ“Œ The Hidden Wiki
"The Hidden Wiki is an uncensored link directory that enlists all the important .onion links. Users can edit it anonymously after registering, pretty much like the regular Wikipedia. Itâ€™s a great starting resource for exploring the dark web. Be careful though, the link directory is full of dead, scam, and illegal links."

ðŸ“Œ Torch
"Torch is the oldest and largest search engine on Tor. It lists over one billion .onion pages, so youâ€™ll surely find what youâ€™re looking for. Whatâ€™s more, Torch wonâ€™t censor your search results or keep logs of your search history. It also doesnâ€™t use web trackers or analytics code like Google does."
URL: torchdeedp3i2jigzjdmfpn5ttjhthh5wbmda2rr3jvqjg5p77c54dqd.onion/


ðŸ“Œ DuckDuckGo
"DuckDuckGo isnâ€™t just your go-to search engine for privacy on the surface web. It can also help you access the dark web. It wonâ€™t log your information or track your dark web sessions. If you couldnâ€™t locate a certain .onion link through Torch, try to find it on DuckDuckGo!"

ProtonMail
"ProtonMailâ€™s .onion version is hands-down the most popular and secure email service on the dark web. Your emails will be end-to-end encrypted, which means no one can intercept your communications. You donâ€™t even need to give your personal details to create a ProtonMail account. Itâ€™s ideal for onion site registrations."

SecureDrop
"SecureDrop is Torâ€™s onion service for whistleblowers., It allows them to share sensitive information with news outlets and independent journalists secretly and securely. Several news organizations, including The Intercept, ProPublica, The New York Times, and The Washington Post have set up their own SecureDrop links to receive documents and tips from people anonymously."
URL: sdolvtfhatvsysc6l34d65ymdwxcujausv7k5jk4cy5ttzhjoi6fzvyd.onion/

ðŸ“Œ Archive Today
"Archive.today is an on-demand webpage capture and storage service. If youâ€™d like to request a capture anonymously, use its .onion version. You could also request a retrieval to see how certain websites have evolved over the years. Itâ€™s just an interesting time passâ€¦ until you discover something controversial on past versions of government or corporate websites. Good luck exploring!"
URL: archiveiya74codqgiixo33q62qlrqtkgmcitqx5u2oeqnmn5bpcbiyd.onion/

Blockchain
"We donâ€™t recommend buying off the dark web market, especially if youâ€™re new to the internetâ€™s underground. That said, use Blockchain.infoâ€™s onion service if you must purchase something. Typically, Torâ€™s exit node would expose you if youâ€™re using bitcoins. This link lets you access your bitcoin wallet without ever exiting the Tor network."
URL: blockchainbdgpzk.onion/

ðŸ“Œ The Intercept https://lnkd.in/dQW3NYuK - 
"The Intercept is your unfiltered source of fearless journalism. The Intercept always relied on the Tor network to receive anonymous reports and investigate powerful people and organizations. It later launched its onion service so readers could browse their newsroom secretly and bypass government-imposed news censorship."
