"Data Driven AI-based Honeypot"
"DataTrap is an innovative and extensible honeypot system that emulates realistic behavior across TCP, HTTP, SSH, and various database protocols. Designed to simulate web applications, IoT devices, and databases, DataTrap goes beyond traditional honeypots by combining recorded payloads, metadata, and a large language model (LLM) to dynamically generate responses that closely mimic real application behavior."
