* After nmapping an IP some ports will have services that are "low hanging fruit", meaning that they are running services for which a lot of exploits exist. Others will be running services that are less likely to be easily exploitable. Focus on the "low hanging fruit" first.

http/https (80/443) - have many exploits
smb (445; smb also may use NetBIOS ports: TCP 139, TCP/UDP 137, UDP 138) - has many exploits

ssh (22) - does NOT have many exploits that are likely to grant RCE

* When working on testing http/https one of the first things to do is to visit the IP in a webbrowser.
* If visiting an IP on a webbrowser brings one to a default webpage that is a finding since it reveals info re the architecture and shows that they have open ports that they are not using (it shows poor hygiene to an attacker and encourages them to look further for misconfigurations)
* run Nikto a web app vulnerability scanner (syntax: nikto -h http://<ip_address> and  nikto -h https://<ip_address>) [Note: Nikto may be blocked if the website has a good WAF)
* attempt to perform directory busting to find accessible directories on the website:
  - there are built in tools in Kali Linux to do this:
    - dirbuster (HA's preferred directory busting tool)
    - dirb
    - gobuster
* check webpage's source code for the possible exposure of sensitive information (e.g. usernames and passwords)

* If ssh is open it is worth trying to connect even if you do not know the password, just in case a banner was left exposed that might give you exploitable information.

Reverse shells vs. bind shells
* in EH one uses reverse shells 95% of the time
* Bind shells come in handy during external PTs where the attack computer is a VM with a private IP using a NAT to present a public IP. It becomes more difficult to set the local IP for the remote host to connect back to. You would need to use the public IP and then use port forwarding. It may be easier in such circumstances to use a bind shell instead. With a bind shell your local IP does not make a difference; you just connect to the remote host IP port you have opened. Bind shells may also be needed if the firewall is blocking the reverse shell or if the reverse shell is just not working for some unknown reason.
