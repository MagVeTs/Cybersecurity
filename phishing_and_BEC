Really well written explanation of how to check if an email is a phish:

"Two Simple Rules That Can Spot Nearly Every Email Phishing Scam"
https://www.digitalcheck.com/how-to-spot-phishing-scams/

HIGHLIGHTS:

"Only pay attention to the last two places in the destination address. We call this the “Second-to-Last-Dot Rule” or the “First Slash Rule.”
What that means is, ignore anything that comes before the second-to-last dot in the URL. Also ignore whatever comes after the first slash in the address. That would mean, ignore everything except:

the “microsoft” and “.com” in https://www.microsoft.com/
the “amazon” and “.ca” in https://www.amazon.ca/ap/signin?_encoding=UTF8
the “scam” and “.co” in https://login.office.microsoft.com.scam.co/microsoft-outlook-login/
 
Notice a pattern? In each case, the REAL address behind the link is what comes right after the second-to-last dot ... and before the first slash ... of the address, also known as the “root domain name” or simply the “domain name.”

Why is this important? Because the root domain name – what comes after the second-to-last dot but before the first slash – is the only part of a website’s address that scammers can’t change. You need to own the domain.

For example, if you own the domain digitalcheck.com, you can put whatever you want before the “digitalcheck.com,” including any number of dots, and you can also put anything you want after it. Let’s say you were trying to steal Amazon passwords. You could create any of the following URLs and set up a fake sign-in page hosted there:

www.digitalcheck.com/
amazon.digitalcheck.com/
amazon.customer.login.digitalcheck.com/
www.digitalcheck.com/amazon/
www.digitalcheck.com/login/amazon-customer-service/
amazon.us1.digitalcheck.com/customer-login/
us1.amazon-login.digitalcheck.com/amazon/login/my-account/
 
But in order to receive any of the incoming clicks in the examples above, you’d have to own the domain name digitalcheck.com and have your fake page set up there. (If you didn’t own the domain, you wouldn’t be scamming anyone; you’d just be sending them to the Digital Check website.)

So, the “real” site is revealed by what comes between the second-to-last dot and the first slash. Scammers can’t fake this part, so it is the one thing that will always be a dead giveaway.

Instead, they’re left with trying to disguise their own scam site as a legitimate one by adding stuff before and after the root domain, and hoping it’s good enough to fool you. Remember, it’s only what comes after the second-to-last dot that counts – the URL https://microsoft.login.com.x.co doesn’t go to microsoft.com or microsoft.login.com – it goes to x.co ...

To summarize our tips for avoiding phishing scams:

When trying to figure out if the message is a scam, ignore the images, design, and text – they can all be manipulated to trick you. Focus on the source of the email and the URLs of the links.
* If the “from” email address has a URL different from the legitimate company’s, delete the message.
* If you think the sender’s identity may be masked, hit the Reply button in Outlook, and see what auto-populates as the actual return address. If it doesn’t match the source, delete the message.
* Hovering your mouse over a link (without clicking!) will display the “real” destination URL. Again, if it doesn’t match the legitimate company’s website address, it’s a scam.
* Only the root domain – the part after the second-to-last dot but before the first slash – in a URL is what matters. Everything else can be faked.
* If the URL in a link contains any hyphens, be suspicious.
* If the message itself contains any misspellings or grammatical errors, be suspicious.
* Above all, if you were not expecting the message, treat it with extra caution!"
