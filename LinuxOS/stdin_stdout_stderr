stdin/stdout/stderr
--------------------

The YouTube video cited below explains the concepts of the three standard files in Linux: Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error. These files function as follows:
* stdin - from the keyboard
* stdout - to the screen
* stderr - also to the screen
The video discusses the redirection of these three files so that:
* the stdout can be sent to a file (using: > <FILENAME> [which will overlay what is already in the file] or >> [which will append to what is already in the file])
* the stdin can be drawn from a file (using: < <FILENAME>)
* the stderr can be separated from the stdout (so it does not clutter the screen) and sent to a file (using: 2><FILENAME>)

stdin = 0 [file descriptor]
stdout = 1 [file descriptor]
stderr = 2 [file descriptor]
