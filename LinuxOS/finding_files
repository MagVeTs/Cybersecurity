Finding Files
-------------
[From: Shotts, William ; The Linux Command Line : A Complete Introduction, 2019 (2nd edition), chpt. 17 p.[195]-208]
If you are searching for a specific file or files and you know its/their name(s) or part of the name(s) the best option is the 'locate' command. The syntax is:
locate <NAME_OF_FILE>
The output is the full pathname of the file you are seeking.
'locate' searches the string you give it anywhere in the filename, so 'locate zip' will output zip, gzip, zipinfo, bunzip2, etc. If you know the directory you can add it so 'locate' will only give output from that directory (e.g. locate bin/zip). You can also grep the results of 'locate'.

If you are searching for a file by attributes the 'find" command should be used instead of 'locate'
