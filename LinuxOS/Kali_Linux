Installing and Updating/Upgrading Kali Linux
----------------------

TIP: It may be necessary to first switch to root user before running update/upgrade (sudo might not be enough):
$ sudo su -
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

TIP: Updating/upgrading Kali linux could conceivably break the OS; it is recommended to use a VM and first make a copy of the VM before attempting to update/upgrade it.
TIP: It is highly recommended to use https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali - "Kali Linux Fixes for Newly Imported VM's" which is a curated update/upgrade that is frequently updated, and will not break anything, and was created by one of HA's colleagues (known as Dewalt).
TIP: When installing tools it is recommended to install them in the /opt directory.

"Here are explanations and examples of the commands mentioned in this video:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade:

Explanation: Updates the package lists and upgrades installed packages on a Debian-based Linux system using the APT package manager.
Example: Running sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade would update the package lists to retrieve information about available updates, and then upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions.

sudo apt install cron-daemon-common:

Explanation: Installs the "cron-daemon-common" package using APT. Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Linux systems, and the "cron-daemon-common" package provides common files and utilities for the cron daemon.
Example: Running sudo apt install cron-daemon-common would download and install the "cron-daemon-common" package on the system.

sudo git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali.git:

Explanation: Clones a Git repository from the specified URL using the Git version control system.
Example: Running sudo git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali.git would clone the repository from the given URL and create a local copy of the repository's files and version history.
These commands are commonly used in Linux systems for updating packages, installing new software, and managing version-controlled repositories. The sudo command is used to execute commands with superuser privileges. The apt command is used for package management in Debian-based distributions. The git command is used for version control and working with Git repositories."
