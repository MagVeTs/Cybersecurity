Comparing Files
----------------
cmp - compares two files byte by byte to see if they are identical 
syntax: cmp <FIRST_FILENAME> <SECOND_FILENAME>
if there is a mismatch, the location of first instance of mismatch is identified by byte number and line number
if files are identical nothing happens; the terminal returns to the prompt

comm - compares two files that have already been sorted
syntax: comm <FIRST_FILENAME> <SECOND_FILENAME>
it displays three columns; the first column is lines unique to first file; the first column is lines unique to second file; the third column is lines identical in both files

diff - compares files and tells you which lines have to be changed in order to make files identical.
syntax: diff <FIRST_FILENAME> <SECOND_FILENAME>
The output uses the following symbols to instruct what steps to take to make the files identical:
* a - add
* c - change
* d - delete
The arrangement of the output on the terminal screen is confusing at first. See the video cited below where parsing the output is explained.
