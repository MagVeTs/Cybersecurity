unzip
-----
"Unzip is a program to unpack, list, test, and compressed (extract) files and it may not be installed by default."

$ sudo apt-get install unzip
OR
$ sudo apt install unzip
# if unzip is not already installed, use these commands to install it on Ubuntu/Debian systems (see: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-unzip-a-zip-file-using-the-linux-and-unix-bash-shell-terminal/ for info on installing it on other Linux distros)

$ man unzip
# read full unzip manual

$ unzip --help
# read basic help info for unzip

$ unzip <FILE_NAME>.zip
# extract a file; extracted file will be in the directory you are presently in

$ unzip <ARCHIVE_NAME>.zip
# extract an archive

$ unzip -d /destination/directory/path <FILE_NAME>.zip
# extract to a particular location

tar
---

Note: use of tar requires that unzip is already installed

$ man tar
# read full tar manual

$ unzip --help
# read basic help info for tar

$ tar xvf <FILE_NAME>.zip
OR
$ tar -xvf <FILE_NAME>.zip
# extract a file; extracted file will be in the directory you are presently in

$ tar xvf <FILE_NAME>.zip -C /destination/directory/path
OR
$ tar -xvf <FILE_NAME>.zip -C /destination/directory/path
# extract to a particular location

Compressing and archiving files and directories
-----------------------------------------------
archiving (tar utility) - takes multiple files/directories and turns them into one file (.tar)
compressing (gzip utility) - takes a file and compresses it to have a smaller size (.gz)

You can compress a regular file or an archive (.tar) file.

tar syntax
tar -cf tarfile.tar file1 file2 (archives file1 and file2 into a tar archive file called tarfile.tar)
tar -xf tarfile.tar (extracts file1 and file2 from the tar archive called tarfile.tar)

gzip syntax:
gzip file1.txt (compresses file1 into file1.txt.gz)
gunzip file1.txt.gz (decompresses file1.txt.gz back to file1.txt)

To check how much disk usage is taken up by a file use the 'du' command
syntax:
du <FILENAME>
You can also use these arguments:
-h (file size in human readable format)
-hc (file sizes and total size)

Note: gzip only can compress one file at a time. tar only archives multiple files into one file, it does not compress. You must first tar and then gzip the tar if you want to compress multiple files at once.
However, multiple files can be archived and compressed in the terminal using 'zip' to do both at once.
syntax: 
* zip <NAME_OF_ZIP_FILE_BEING_CREATED> <NAME_OF_FIRST_FILE_BEING_ZIPPED> <NAME_OF_SECOND_FILE_BEING_ZIPPED>
The resulting file will have a .zip extension.
To unzip a zipped file, use the syntax: unzip <NAME_OF_ZIPPED_FILE>.

Another option for archiving files is rar. Rar files are both archived and compressed. rar files have a .rar extension.
The syntax is:
rar a <NAME_OF_RAR_FILE_BEING_CREATED> <NAME_OF_FIRST_FILE_BEING_RARRED> <NAME_OF_SECOND_FILE_BEING_RARRED> [the a parameter is to add the archive]
unrar e <NAME_OF_RAR_FILE_BEING_EXTRACTED> [the e parameter is to extract the files from the archive]
