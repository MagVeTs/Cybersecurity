Linux File System
-----------------
* in Linux everything is treated as a file (including devices)
* files are case sensitive
* can contain up to 255 characters
* can contain any character (including whitespace) except /
* extensions are not needed/interpreted; they are only for user convenience

Every file is part of a path - the unique location of the file represented by alphanumeric names of parent directories and the file divided by /
The first / represents root directory and the following slashes delimit nested directories under root and finally the file.

In the Linux FHS [File Hierarchy Structure/Filesystem Hierarchy Standard] all files are listed under root (/) even if they are found on different physical/virtual machines.
Only root (/) directory has no parent.
Only the root user can write to the root directory.
The root user's home directory is: /root (note: / != /root)

A "home directory" is the main repository for a user's file's (including their configuration file). When a user logs into a system, by default they usually start off in their home directory. [In the command line prompt the presence of ~ represents that a user is now in their home directory.]
As stated above: the root user's home directory is: /root.
Other users' home directories are by default created with the /home directory.

------------------------------------------------
In the command line prompt the presence of ~ represents that a user is now in their home directory.
The command 'cd ~' will return you to your home directory from wherever you are in the file system.
