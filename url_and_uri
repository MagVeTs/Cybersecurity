"URL Redirect Checker
What is a URL redirect checker?
Have you ever wondered: Where does this link go? The URL redirect checker follows the path of the URL. It will show you the full redirection path of URLs, shortened links, or tiny URLs. Also referred to as a link checker, url checker, redirect checker, link tracker, url tracker, redirect tracer, link follower, 301 redirect checker, redirect tracker, URL tester, and so on.

When the link checker traces a link, the results display all the links that you are being redirected through including php redirects, htaccess redirects, NGINX redirects, JavaScript redirects and meta-refreshes eventually leading you to the final destination...

Tiny URL Expander
If you want to know where a tiny link goes, then you can also use WhereGoes as a link expander. It will show you exactly where that tiny URL goes and the full path of it. This is great to use if you are unsure where the link will take you or you want to see what affiliates are involved in the redirection process."
