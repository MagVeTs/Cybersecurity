$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt upgrade

$ sudo apt install docker.io

$ docker --version
# if you want to see the version of Docker you have installed

$ sudo apt install docker-compose

$ docker-compose --version
# if you want to see the version of Docker Compose you have installed

In the lab setup being discussed in the lecture, one downloads the tar file available below the lecture video (peh-web-labs.tar.gz) and then cd to the directory containing the file. The one runs the following commands.

$ tar -xf peh-web-labs.tar.gz

$ cd peh

$ cd labs

then finally and significant for proper use of Docker, one runs Docker Compose from within the directory that holds the downloaded "docker-compose.yml" file (the "labs" directory in this case). The command is:

$ sudo docker-compose up

In order to stop a Docker container from running use:
<CTRL><C>.

In order to run the Docker container in the background so that it will be running but you can still use the terminal add -d to the "up" command, as follows:

$ sudo docker-compose up -d

In order to see what Docker containers are presently running, use the command:
$ sudo docker ps -a

In order to stop all currently running Docker containers, use the command:
$ sudo docker-compose stop

In order to remove Docker containers use the following command:
$ sudo docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>
or, to remove all containers on the system:
$ sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aq)
