Sigma Rules
-----------
- "Sigma is for log files as Snort is for network traffic, and Yara is for files." (https://tryhackme.com/room/sigma)
- Sigma rules are written in YAML and are used to detect malicious behaviour; usually within a SIEM platform

--------------------------------
YAML (http://yaml.org/) info:
* YAML file extension: .yml
* is case-sensitive
* <SPACE> to indent (not <TAB>)
* # = comment
* key:value pairs denoted by `:` (colon)
* array elements denoted by `-` (dash)
