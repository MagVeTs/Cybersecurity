theHarvester
-------------
* gathers employee names, email addresses, subdomains, hosts, PGP key entries, open ports and service banners from servers
* installed by default on Kali linux; can use Google or other search engines; can search LinkedIn and other social media
* recon-ng is similar but better
* syntax:
$ theHarvester
# starts theHarvester
$ theHarvester -d udemy.com -l 5 -b google
# -d = target domain (subdomains are automatically included)
# -l = limit search results to a chosen number
# -b = search engine to use for the search
NOTE: Google may consider theHarvester a bot and block it from properly executing; it may be necessary to run theHarvester through TOR so that the requests for the documents are seen to come from many different IPs and therefore will escape being blocked by Google
