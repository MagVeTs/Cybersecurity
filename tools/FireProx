[from: https://tryhackme.com/room/awsapigateway ; Task 5 - "Using API Gateway for Offensive Purposes"]

https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox



FireProx uses AWS API Gateway to rotate IP addresses for web requests. It uses an API Gateway endpoint to redirect requests to configured domain/IP.
Can be used for password spraying and other cred attacks (see: https://github.com/knavesec/CredMaster).
Can be used to make requests to HTTP/S or WebSocket endpoints that have IP-based restrictions or use rate-limiting.

Commands:

user@machine$ git clone https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox
