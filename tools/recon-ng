recon-ng
* like the Harvester, but better
* really complete, all-in-one tool, for passive reconnaisance/OSINT (in the same way that Metasploit is an all-in-one tool for exploits)
* has all kinds of modules that allow it to be used for many types of OSINT searches
* Python based' cross-platform compatabile
* installed on Kali Linux by default
* by default no modules are loaded in recon-ng; you must install modules to use (see below)
* NOTE: big change in recon-ng syntax between version 4 and version 5; online guides and tutorials for a different version than is being used will not be helpful
* syntax:
$ recon-ng
# starts recon-ng; prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][default] > `

$ recon-ng -w <NAME_OF_WORKSPACE>
# starts within a workspace that you have already created to store all your OSINT on a particular target; ; the prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][WORKSPACE_NAME] > `

[recon-ng] > help
# displays list of commands; choose a command about which you wish to learn more and enter it - info will be displayed

[recon-ng][default] > workspaces create <WORKSPACE_NAME, e.g. tesla>
# creates workspace

[recon-ng][default] > workspaces list
# list available workspaces

[recon-ng][default] > workspaces load <WORKSPACE_NAME>
# load a particular workspace; the prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][WORKSPACE_NAME] > `

[recon-ng][default] > modules search
# list modules already installed

[recon-ng][default] > marketplace search
# list all the modules available for installation

[recon-ng][default] > marketplace install all
# installs all modules (the ones that do not yet have API keys installed will generate error messages stating that)

[recon-ng][default] > marketplace install recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
# installs a particular module (in this case the module is "recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs"
# NOTE: some modules will require API key to use; for example in order to use the module that searches Twitter you first need to register with Twitter and request an API key (see here:
# https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api); then you can plug the API key into the associated module and use it

[recon-ng][tesla] > marketplace load whois_pocs
# loads a particular module; the prompt will change to: `[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > `

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > info
# display info re the current module

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > db schema
# shows available fields in the database that can be populated with data

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > db insert domains
# chooses the "domains" field as the field that will be receiving data; the target domains will be input into this field
# a prompt will appear for the data: `domain (TEXT): `
# you can add multiple domains but you have to issue the `db insert domains` for each one 

[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > show domains
# see a list of domains in the db; `show` followed by any schema present in the db will pull that schema

[recon-ng][tesla][[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > run
# runs the present module (in this case `whois_pocs`)

[recon-ng][tesla][[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > show contacts
# retrieves contacts from db (these contacts were added by running the `whois_pocs` module); remember:  `show` followed by any schema present in the db will pull that schema
# NOTE: info from other modules used in the workspace will also be loaded to the same db; the info will be tagged with the module that produced it

[recon-ng][tesla][[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > back
# goes back a level in the prompt; in this case the present module will be exited, so `[recon-ng][tesla][[recon-ng][tesla][whois_pocs] > ` will change to `[recon-ng][tesla][[recon-ng][tesla] > `
