"autoNTDS is a Python utility that facilitates the extraction of NTDS dumps, cracks the hashes using hashcat, and post-processes the results to match users with their cracked passwords. This tool is designed to streamline the process of handling NTDS hashes."

Heath Adams (The Cyber Mentor)'s announcement on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heathadams_github-hmaverickadamsautontds-autontds-activity-7125242333029093376-w_il?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop):

"I'm happy to announce a new tool: autoNTDS

The tool has three main functionalities:
1) Automatically dumps the NTDS.dit, removing unnecessary accounts, such as computer and guest accounts, and parsing them into relevant text files for easy cracking. (--ntds)
2) Automatic hash cracking with Hashcat. Simply run the NTDS dump with your favorite wordlist and the cracking process will be handled automagically! (--crack)
3) User/password matching. If you decide to run cracking elsewhere, you can still provide the cracked hashes with the original NTDS dump, which will provide you a list of users and their respective passwords. (--passwords-to-users)

All in all, this should simplify and speed up the NTDS dumping and cracking process. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!"
