$ gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo <CIPHER> <FILE_NAME>.txt
# <CIPHER> = name of chosen cipher
# <FILE_NAME>.txt = name of file being encrypted; encrypted output file will be saved as "<FILE_NAME>.txt.gpg"
# default output is in OpenPGP format (binary); to output in armored ASCII (openable in any text editor) add argument `--armor`

$ gpg --output original_message.txt --decrypt <FILE_NAME>.txt.gpg
# decrypts encrypted message and outputs it to a file with the value assigned by the `--output` argument
