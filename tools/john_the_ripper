Cracking a hash found in Linux's /etc/shadow file in order to get a password
1) cat /etc/shadow
example output:
matt:$6$WHmIjebL7MA7KN9A$C4UBJB4WVI37r.Ct3Hbhd3YOcua3AUowO2w2RUNauW8IigHAyVlHzhLrIUxVSGa.twjHc71MoBJfjCTxrkiLR.:18798:0:99999:7:::

2) copy hash and paste it into text file:
$6$WHmIjebL7MA7KN9A$C4UBJB4WVI37r.Ct3Hbhd3YOcua3AUowO2w2RUNauW8IigHAyVlHzhLrIUxVSGa.twjHc71MoBJfjCTxrkiLR.
save text file; in this case we will call it Matt

3) run john the ripper as follows:
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt matt
the password retrieved from the cracked hash will be shown amongst other data

4) after having run john the ripper you can show just the password by the following command:
john matt --show
