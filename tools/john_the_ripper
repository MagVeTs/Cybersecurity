Cracking a hash found in Linux's /etc/shadow file in order to get a password
1) cat /etc/shadow
example output:
matt:$6$WHmIjebL7MA7KN9A$C4UBJB4WVI37r.Ct3Hbhd3YOcua3AUowO2w2RUNauW8IigHAyVlHzhLrIUxVSGa.twjHc71MoBJfjCTxrkiLR.:18798:0:99999:7:::

2) copy hash and paste it into text file:
$6$WHmIjebL7MA7KN9A$C4UBJB4WVI37r.Ct3Hbhd3YOcua3AUowO2w2RUNauW8IigHAyVlHzhLrIUxVSGa.twjHc71MoBJfjCTxrkiLR.
save text file; in this case we will call it Matt

3) run john the ripper as follows:
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt matt
the password retrieved from the cracked hash will be shown amongst other data

4) after having run john the ripper you can show just the password by the following command:
john matt --show

Setting Up John The Ripper
John the Ripper is supported on many different Operating Systems, not just Linux Distributions. As a note before we go through this, there are multiple versions of John, the standard "core" distribution, as well as multiple community editions- which extend the feature set of the original John distribution. The most popular of these distributions is the "Jumbo John"- which we will be using specific features of later.


Parrot, Kali and AttackBox
If you're using Parrot OS, Kali Linux or TryHackMe's own AttackBox- you should already have Jumbo John installed. You can double check this by typing john into the terminal. You should be met with a usage guide for john, with the first line reading: "John the Ripper 1.9.0-jumbo-1" or similar with a different version number. If not, you can use sudo apt install john to install it.


Blackarch
If you're using Blackarch, or the Blackarch repositories you may or may not have Jumbo John installed, to check if you do, use the command pacman -Qe | grep "john" You should be met with an output similar to "john 1.9.0.jumbo1-5" or similar with a different version number. If you do not have it installed, you can simply use pacman -S john to install it.

Building from Source for Linux
If you wish to build the package from source to meet your system requirements, you can do this in five fairly straightforward steps. Further advice on the installation process and how to configure your build from source can be found here.

Use git clone https://github.com/openwall/john -b bleeding-jumbo john to clone the jumbo john repository to your current working
Then cd john/src/ to change your current directory to where the source code is. 
Once you're in this directory, use ./configure to check the required dependencies and options that have been configured.
If you're happy with this output, and have installed any required dependencies that are needed, use make -s clean && make -sj4 to build a binary of john. This binary will be in the above run directory, which you can change to with cd ../run
You can test this binary using ./john --test

Installing on Windows
To install Jumbo John the Ripper on Windows, you just need to download and install the zipped binary for either 64 bit systems here: https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0-jumbo-1-win64.zip; or for 32 bit systems here: https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0-jumbo-1-win32.zip.

Wordlists
[I]n order to dictionary attack hashes, you need a list of words that you can hash and compare, unsurprisingly this is called a wordlist. There are many different wordlists out there, a good collection to use can be found in the SecLists repository (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

There are also a few places you can look for wordlists on your attacking system of choice, we will quickly run through where you can find them:

Parrot, Kali and AttackBox
On Parrot, Kali and TryHackMe's AttackBox- you can find a series of amazing wordlists in the /usr/share/wordlists directory.

RockYou
[There is also] the infamous rockyou.txt wordlist- which is a very large common password wordlist, obtained from a data breach on a website called rockyou.com in 2009. If you are not using any of the above distributions, you can get the rockyou.txt wordlist from the SecLists repository under the /Passwords/Leaked-Databases subsection. You may need to extract it from .tar.gz format, using tar xvzf rockyou.txt.tar.gz.

Cracking Basic Hashes
There are multiple ways to use John the Ripper to crack simple hashes, we're going to walk through a few, before moving on to cracking some ourselves.

John Basic Syntax
The basic syntax of John the Ripper commands is as follows. We will cover the specific options and modifiers used as we use them.

john [options] [path to file]

john - Invokes the John the Ripper program

[path to file] - The file containing the hash you're trying to crack, if it's in the same directory you won't need to name a path, just the file.


Automatic Cracking
John has built-in features to detect what type of hash it's being given, and to select appropriate rules and formats to crack it for you, this isn't always the best idea as it can be unreliable- but if you can't identify what hash type you're working with and just want to try cracking it, it can be a good option! To do this we use the following syntax:

john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]

--wordlist= - Specifies using wordlist mode, reading from the file that you supply in the following path...

[path to wordlist] - The path to the wordlist you're using, as described in the previous task.

Example Usage:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt



Identifying Hashes
Sometimes John won't play nicely with automatically recognising and loading hashes, that's okay! We're able to use other tools to identify the hash, and then set john to use a specific format. There are multiple ways to do this, such as using an online hash identifier like this one: https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. I like to use a tool called hash-identifier (https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/tree/kali/master), a Python tool that is super easy to use and will tell you what different types of hashes the one you enter is likely to be, giving you more options if the first one fails.

To use hash-identifier, you can just pull the python file from gitlab using:wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py.

Then simply launch it with python3 hash-id.py and then enter the hash you're trying to identify- and it will give you possible formats!


Format-Specific Cracking
Once you have identified the hash that you're dealing with, you can tell john to use it while cracking the provided hash using the following syntax:

john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]

--format= - This is the flag to tell John that you're giving it a hash of a specific format, and to use the following format to crack it

[format] - The format that the hash is in

Example Usage:

john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt

A Note on Formats:

When you are telling john to use formats, if you're dealing with a standard hash type, e.g. md5 as in the example above, you have to prefix it withraw- to tell john you're just dealing with a standard hash type, though this doesn't always apply. To check if you need to add the prefix or not, you can list all of John's formats using john --list=formats and either check manually, or grep for your hash type using something like john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5".
