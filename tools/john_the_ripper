Cracking a hash found in Linux's /etc/shadow file in order to get a password
1) cat /etc/shadow
example output:
matt:$6$WHmIjebL7MA7KN9A$C4UBJB4WVI37r.Ct3Hbhd3YOcua3AUowO2w2RUNauW8IigHAyVlHzhLrIUxVSGa.twjHc71MoBJfjCTxrkiLR.:18798:0:99999:7:::

2) copy hash and paste it into text file:
$6$WHmIjebL7MA7KN9A$C4UBJB4WVI37r.Ct3Hbhd3YOcua3AUowO2w2RUNauW8IigHAyVlHzhLrIUxVSGa.twjHc71MoBJfjCTxrkiLR.
save text file; in this case we will call it Matt

3) run john the ripper as follows:
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt matt
the password retrieved from the cracked hash will be shown amongst other data

4) after having run john the ripper you can show just the password by the following command:
john matt --show

Setting Up John The Ripper
John the Ripper is supported on many different Operating Systems, not just Linux Distributions. As a note before we go through this, there are multiple versions of John, the standard "core" distribution, as well as multiple community editions- which extend the feature set of the original John distribution. The most popular of these distributions is the "Jumbo John"- which we will be using specific features of later.


Parrot, Kali and AttackBox
If you're using Parrot OS, Kali Linux or TryHackMe's own AttackBox- you should already have Jumbo John installed. You can double check this by typing john into the terminal. You should be met with a usage guide for john, with the first line reading: "John the Ripper 1.9.0-jumbo-1" or similar with a different version number. If not, you can use sudo apt install john to install it.


Blackarch
If you're using Blackarch, or the Blackarch repositories you may or may not have Jumbo John installed, to check if you do, use the command pacman -Qe | grep "john" You should be met with an output similar to "john 1.9.0.jumbo1-5" or similar with a different version number. If you do not have it installed, you can simply use pacman -S john to install it.

Building from Source for Linux
If you wish to build the package from source to meet your system requirements, you can do this in five fairly straightforward steps. Further advice on the installation process and how to configure your build from source can be found here.

Use git clone https://github.com/openwall/john -b bleeding-jumbo john to clone the jumbo john repository to your current working
Then cd john/src/ to change your current directory to where the source code is. 
Once you're in this directory, use ./configure to check the required dependencies and options that have been configured.
If you're happy with this output, and have installed any required dependencies that are needed, use make -s clean && make -sj4 to build a binary of john. This binary will be in the above run directory, which you can change to with cd ../run
You can test this binary using ./john --test

Installing on Windows
To install Jumbo John the Ripper on Windows, you just need to download and install the zipped binary for either 64 bit systems here: https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0-jumbo-1-win64.zip; or for 32 bit systems here: https://www.openwall.com/john/k/john-1.9.0-jumbo-1-win32.zip.

Wordlists
[I]n order to dictionary attack hashes, you need a list of words that you can hash and compare, unsurprisingly this is called a wordlist. There are many different wordlists out there, a good collection to use can be found in the SecLists repository (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).

There are also a few places you can look for wordlists on your attacking system of choice, we will quickly run through where you can find them:

Parrot, Kali and AttackBox
On Parrot, Kali and TryHackMe's AttackBox- you can find a series of amazing wordlists in the /usr/share/wordlists directory.

RockYou
[There is also] the infamous rockyou.txt wordlist- which is a very large common password wordlist, obtained from a data breach on a website called rockyou.com in 2009. If you are not using any of the above distributions, you can get the rockyou.txt wordlist from the SecLists repository under the /Passwords/Leaked-Databases subsection. You may need to extract it from .tar.gz format, using tar xvzf rockyou.txt.tar.gz.
