- LLMNR Poisoning


- SMB Relay
* instead of cracking a captured hash, relay it directly to another machine in the network to gain access
* only works with machines that have SMB signing either DISABLED or NOT ENFORCED (this is default for workstations; but servers usually have SMB signing enabled and enforced)
* only worthwhile if the relayed credentials have at least local admin priv on the machine you are attacking
* sample nmap scan to check which machines in domain do not have SMB signing enforced:
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 10.0.0.0/24
(or try Nessus to find these vulnerable machines)
