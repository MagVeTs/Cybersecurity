Metasploit: Introduction
An introduction to the main components of the Metasploit Framework.
From: https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitintro [with some editing]

"Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

Metasploit has two main versions:

Metasploit Pro: The commercial version that facilitates the automation and management of tasks. This version has a graphical user interface (GUI).
Metasploit Framework: The open-source version that works from the command line...

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.


The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows;

msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
Modules: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
Tools: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development which is beyond the scope of this module.

While using the Metasploit Framework, you will primarily interact with the Metasploit console. You can launch it ... using the msfconsole command. The console will be your main interface to interact with the different modules of the Metasploit Framework. Modules are small components within the Metasploit framework that are built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.

Before diving into modules, it would be helpful to clarify a few recurring concepts: vulnerability, exploit, and payload.

Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

Modules and categories under each one are listed below. These are given for reference purposes, but you will interact with them through the Metasploit console (msfconsole).
- Auxiliary: Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.
- Encoders: Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match. Thus encoders can have a limited success rate as antivirus solutions can perform additional checks.
- Evasion: While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software.
On the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.
- Exploits: Exploits, neatly organized by target system.
- NOPs: NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally.
They are represented in the Intel x86 CPU family they are represented with 0x90, following which the CPU will do nothing for one cycle. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.
- Payloads: Payloads are codes that will run on the target system.
Exploits will leverage a vulnerability on the target system, but to achieve the desired result, we will need a payload. Examples could be; getting a shell, loading     a malware or backdoor to the target system, running a command, or launching calc.exe as a proof of concept to add to the penetration test report. Starting the       calculator on the target system remotely by launching the calc.exe application is a benign way to show that we can run commands on the target system.
Running command on the target system is already an important step but having an interactive connection that allows you to type commands that will be executed on the target system is better. Such an interactive command line is called a "shell". Metasploit offers the ability to send different payloads that can open shells on the target system.
You will see three different directories under payloads: singles, stagers and stages.
1) Singles: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
2) Stagers: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
3) Stages: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.
Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify single (also called “inline”) payloads and staged payloads.
generic/shell_reverse_tcp
windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
Both are reverse Windows shells. The former is an inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the “_” between “shell” and “reverse”. While the latter is a staged payload, as indicated by the “/” between “shell” and “reverse”.
- Post: Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.

If you wish to familiarize yourself further with these modules, you can find them under the modules folder of your Metasploit installation. 

As previously mentioned, the console will be your main interface to the Metasploit Framework. You can launch it using the msfconsole command on ... any system the Metasploit Framework is installed on.

Once launched, you will see the command line changes to msf5 (or msf6 depending on the installed version of Metasploit). The Metasploit console (msfconsole) can be used just like a regular command-line shell, as you can see below.

The first command [to learn] is ls which lists the contents of the folder from which Metasploit was launched using the msfconsole command.

Another commans is ping sent to Google's DNS IP address (8.8.8.8). Since, you are using Linux you meed to add the -c 1 option, so only a single ping was sent. Otherwise, the ping process will continue until it is stopped using CTRL+C.
