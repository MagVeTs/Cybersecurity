TIP: It is highly recommended to use https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali - "Kali Linux Fixes for Newly Imported VM's" which is a curated update/upgrade that is frequently updated, and will not break anything, and was created by one of HA's colleagues (known as Dewalt). It installs a lot of important tools.

https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali
"Kali Linux Fixes for Newly Imported VM's"

syntax for installing:

$ rm -rf pimpmykali/ 
[NOTE: you only need to execute this step if you already have an older version of pimpmykali on the device and you need to remove it before getting the newer version]
$ cd /opt/
$ git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali.git
$ cd pimpmykali/
$ sudo ./pimpmykali.sh/
$ N
[NOTE: run this menu option in order to run the entire pimpmykali tool (e.g. if you have a new VM); there are other menu options that will allow to install or fix specific tools using pimpmykali]
