... What is Gobuster?
As the name implies, Gobuster is written in Go (https://go.dev/). Go is an open-source, low-level language (much like C or Rust) developed by a team at Google and other contributors. If you'd like to learn more about Go, visit the website linked above.

Installing Gobuster on Kali Linux

Luckily, installing Gobuster on Kali Linux does not require any installation of Go and does not carry with it a complicated install process. This means no building from source or running any other complicated commands. The command is:
sudo apt install gobuster

... Useful Global Flags
There are some useful Global flags that can be used as well. They are included in the table below. You can review these in the main documentation as well - here: https://github.com/OJ/gobuster.

Flag	Long Flag	Description
-t	--threads	Number of concurrent threads (default 10)
-v	--verbose	Verbose output
-z	--no-progress	Don't display progress
-q	--quiet	Don't print the banner and other noise
-o	--output	Output file to write results to
It is recommended to change the number of threads to 64 to increase the speed of scans. If you don't change the number of threads, Gobuster can be a little slow.
