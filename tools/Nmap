Nmap target specification options:
- list: MACHINE_IP scanme.nmap.org example.com will scan 3 IP addresses.
- range: 10.11.12.15-20 will scan 6 IP addresses: 10.11.12.15, 10.11.12.16,… and 10.11.12.20.
- subnet: MACHINE_IP/30 will scan 4 IP addresses.
You can also provide a file as input for your list of targets: nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt.

Check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan (helpful for situations where you are planning to scan a subnet and do not want to calculate the IP addresses in that subnet - Nmap will do the math for you and list all the possible IPs in the subnet you gave):
nmap -sL TARGETS.
(this option will give you a detailed list of the hosts that Nmap will scan without scanning them; however, Nmap will attempt a reverse-DNS resolution on all the targets to obtain their names. Names might reveal various information to the pentester. [If you don’t want Nmap to the DNS server, you can add -n.])

Nmap Host Discovery Scan Types (i.e. without port scans) With Example Command
-------------------------------------
ARP Scan:	sudo nmap -PR -sn MACHINE_IP/24
(ARP scans only allowed for root and sudoers; ARP scans only work for machines in your own subnet; there is also a dedicated ARP scan tool called arp-scan [http://www.royhills.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page]); install on Linux: apt install arp-scan)
ICMP Echo Scan:	sudo nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24 [may be blocked by firewalls - worth trying all ICMP types in case one isn't blocked]
ICMP Timestamp Scan:	sudo nmap -PP -sn MACHINE_IP/24 [may be blocked by firewalls - worth trying all ICMP types in case one isn't blocked]
ICMP Address Mask Scan:	sudo nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24 [may be blocked by firewalls - worth trying all ICMP types in case one isn't blocked]
TCP SYN Ping Scan:	sudo nmap -PS22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30 [will work even for unprivileged users; however, only root/sudoers can avoid completion of 3-way handshake]
TCP ACK Ping Scan:	sudo nmap -PA22,80,443 -sn MACHINE_IP/30 [only available for root/sudoers]
UDP Ping Scan:	sudo nmap -PU53,161,162 -sn MACHINE_IP/30 [if the port is closed this generates an ICMP Type 3, Code 3 (port unreachable response) - then you know the host is up; if no response is received you do not know if the host is down or the host is up but the port is open; therefore, it is important to send the UDP Ping Scan specifically to weird ports that would probably be closed (if you are using it for host discovery purposes)]

Option	- Purpose
-n	      no reverse-DNS lookup
-R	      do reverse-DNS lookup for ALL hosts (including those presently offline)
-sn	      perform host discovery only; do not scan for open ports

masscan is a scanning tool similar to Nmap. However, it is quicker because its packet generating rate is aggressive. Install on Linux: apt install masscan.
Example syntax:
masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p443
masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p80,443
masscan MACHINE_IP/24 -p22-25
masscan MACHINE_IP/24 ‐‐top-ports 100
