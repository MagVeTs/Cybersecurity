[note: quiet-riot works great with using AWS CLI from an attack box after doing `aws configure`. quiet-riot will use the "default" credentials that are set up when you do `aws configure`. If you are trying to use quiet-riot from within the AWS CloudShell interface quiet-riot may look in ~/.aws/credentials and be unable to find anything because CloudShell uses AWS metadata service (https://kloudle.com/academy/a-technical-analysis-of-the-aws-cloudshell-service/) for the creds instead. So you will have to set up the creds in CloudShell first before running quiet-riot.]
