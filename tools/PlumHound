* see: Heath Adams - The Cyber Mentor ; Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course ; "Domain Enumeration with Plumhound" - https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/1152300/lectures/48515111
syntax:
$ cd /opt
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound.git
$ cd PlumHound
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ sudo python3 PlumHound.py --easy -p <your_neo4j_password>
[this command is done to make sure that PlumHound is working properly; it does a very basic domain query that does not generate much info; if it executes the task correctly you move on to other more helpful queries]
$ sudo python3 PlumHound.py -x tasks/default.tasks -p <your_neo4j_password>
[* this is the default task for PlumHound; see the GitHub documentation for other options; however, HA says that the default works very well
* the output is many report files which are placed in the reports/ directory; PlumHound also creates a zip file of all the reports in that directory]
