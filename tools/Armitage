Task 4 - Setting up a C2 Framework

"Armitage is a GUI for the Metasploit Framework, and because of this, it has almost all aspects of a standard C2 framework...

Setting Up Armitage
Downloading, Building, and Installing Armitage"

1) Clone the repository from Gitlab:
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/armitage.git && cd armitage

2) Build the current release:
$ bash package.sh

3) After completion of building process check ./releases/unix/ to confirm build:
$ cd ./release/unix/ && ls -la

You should see something like this:

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root    4096 Feb  6 20:20 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root    4096 Feb  6 20:20 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root      75 Feb  6 20:20 armitage
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4334705 Feb  6 20:20 armitage.jar
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   25985 Feb  6 20:20 armitage-logo.png
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     282 Feb  6 20:20 build.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6778470 Feb  6 20:20 cortana.jar
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    1491 Feb  6 20:20 license.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    4385 Feb  6 20:20 readme.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    2665 Feb  6 20:20 teamserver
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   85945 Feb  6 20:20 whatsnew.txt

The two most important files are:
- armitage -  file used to launch GUI to connect to the Armitage Teamserver.
- teamserver - starts Armitage server; multiple users will be able to connect to it; takes two arguments (IP Address that redteam will connect to; shared password redteam will use to authenticate)

4) Make sure Metasploit is properly configured; it is heavily used by Armitage; enable Metasploit DB capabilities by starting PostgreSQL:
$ systemctl start postgresql && systemctl status postgresql

5) Start Metasploit DB:
$ msfdb --use-defaults delete
[NOTE: do not be in Root when you run this command]

6) Start/Connect to Armitage; and set your password:
$ cd /opt/armitage/release/unix && ./teamserver <YourIP> <PASSWORD>

7) Start Armitage client (you only need to cd to the directory if you have left the directory since the last command):
$ cd /opt/armitage/release/unix && ./armitage

Note:
"When operating a C2 Framework, you never want to expose the management interface publicly; You should always listen on a local interface, never a public-facing one. This complicates access for fellow operators. Fortunately, there is an easy solution for this. For operators to gain access to the server, you should create a new user account for them and enable SSH access on the server, and they will be able to SSH port forward TCP/55553.  Armitage explicitly denies users listening on 127.0.0.1; this is because it is essentially a shared Metasploit server with a "Deconfliction Server" that when multiple users are connecting to the server, you're not seeing everything that your other users are seeing. With Armitage, you must listen on your tun0/eth0 IP Address [https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoc2]."

"how to securely access your C2 server by SSH port-forwarding"
"SSH port-forwarding allows us to either host resources on a remote machine by forwarding a local port to the remote server, or allows us to access local resources on the remote machine we are connecting to"
If, for example the Teamserver is listening on localhost on TCP/55553 and we want to connect remotely to the teamserver, in order to access Remote port 55553, we must set up a Local port-forward to forward our local port to the remote Teamserver server:

$ ssh -L 55553:127.0.0.1:55553 root@192.168.0.44
