- use the mimikatz found in this github repository: https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/, not this one: https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz
- at this point use of mimikatz will be picked up by any AV/EDR system so it can only be used without triggering an alert if it is heavily obfuscated or you are already in control of the AV/EDR.

$ mimikatz.exe
- launch mimikatz

mimikatz #
- this is the mimikatz command line prompt

mimikatz # privilege::debug
- always run this command first; you should receive:
Privilege '20' OK
as the response
see here: https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821, where it explains: "PRIVILEGE::Debug â€“ get debug rights (this or Local System rights is required for many Mimikatz commands)"
