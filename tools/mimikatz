- use the mimikatz found in this github repository: https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/, not this one: https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz
- at this point use of mimikatz will be picked up by any AV/EDR system so it can only be used without triggering an alert if it is heavily obfuscated or you are already in control of the AV/EDR.
