You can create the below script using the gedit command:
$ gedit <name_of_script_file>.sh

Do not forget to make it executable before running it:
$ chmod +x <name_of_script_file>.sh

------------------
#!/bin/bash
url=$1 # $1 means the first argument

if [ ! -d "$url" ];then # these lines create the needed directories if they do not yet exist
        mkdir $url
fi

if [ ! -d "$url/recon" ];then 
        mkdir $url/recon

fi

echo "[+] "Harvesting subdomains with assetfinder..."
assetfinder $url >> $url/recon/assets.txt # runs assetfinder with full discovery and forwards output to new file named "assets"
cat $url/recon/assets.txt | grep $1 >> $url/recon/final.txt # extracts only subdomains of the main domain and forwards them to a new file named "final"
rm $url/recon/assets.txt # NOTE: only leave this command in the script if you want to then remove the "assets" file
