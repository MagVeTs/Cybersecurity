smbclient allows a connection to be made to smb shares

syntax:

* smbclient -L \\\\<IP_address_of_smb_share>\\
  -L = list the shares on an smb share
  [Note: use at least two \\; Heath Adams uses four; if you use just two at beginning you do not have to use two at end; slashes are for Linux character escaping]

* smbclient \\\\<IP_address_of_smb_share>\\<sharename>
this command will access a particular share

[Note if you do not know password try just hitting enter; anonymous access may be allowed.]
