BloodHound
-----------

* see: Heath Adams - The Cyber Mentor ; Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course ; "Domain Enumeration with Bloodhound" - https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/1152300/lectures/48515110
* often updated so it is worthwhile to run the following command before using, even if bloodhound is already on your system:
$ sudo pip install bloodhound
* after installation/update, the syntax is as follows:
$ sudo neo4j console
- this console is necessary for the use of bloodhound
- after running this command a local host link (e.g. "Remote interface available at: http://localhost:7474") will be created that you can click on to get to the neo4j console through a browser window
* if this is the first access you will be asked to sign in, the credentials are:
UN: neo4j
PW: neo4j
(you will be asked to change your password)
* return to the terminal and input:
$ sudo bloodhound
* bloodhound will now open and you will input your neo4j UN/PW
