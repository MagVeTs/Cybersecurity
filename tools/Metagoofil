* Linux based; search through documents on a target's website; retrieve metadata; uses Python; can be used on all OSs not just Linux
* Not installed by default on Kali Linux; type metagoofil and it will ask if you want to install it
* sample syntax:
$ metagoofil -d udemy.com -t doc,docx,ppt,pptx,pdf -l 50 -n 25 -o udemy_files -f 
# -d = target domain (Metagoofil will automatically search subdomains of the target domain)
# -t = file types to search for
# -l = stop search after X number of files found
# -n = limit number of found files to be downloaded
# -o = create an output directory within the current working directory for all downloaded files to be stored
# -f = put all the results in one html file
NOTE: Google may consider Metagoofil a bot and block it from properly executing; it may be necessary to run Metagoofil through TOR so that the requests for the documents are seen to come from many different IPs and therefore will escape being blocked by Google
