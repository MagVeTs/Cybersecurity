$ grep -E 'post=1[0-9]' apache-ex2.log
# in this use case we are dealing with a log containing this type of entry:
# 203.0.113.1 - - [02/Aug/2023:10:15:23 +0000] "GET /blog.php?post=12 HTTP/1.1" 200 - "Mozilla/5.0"
# blog posts are identified by ID numbers as found, in this example, to be 12 (i.e. post=12)
# we want to grep all blog post entries between 10 and 19
# -E = search for a pattern as opposed to a grep search for a string which is without the -E (another option is to use the command `egrep` which defaults to a pattern search
# the `post=` section is a string (strings and patterns can be searched for together)
# 1[0-9] = this is the regex pattern that is being sought; in this case the pattern is a two digit number whose first digit is 1 and whose second digit is either 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9; any line from the log that contains  # the string `post=` immediately followed by a number that matches the pattern will be displayed


Example regex used to find all IP addresses in a file:
\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b
# \b = opening word boundary anchor; ensures the match is on a FULL IP address
# [0-9]{1,3} = match a 1, 2, or 3 digit number; each digit may be between 0-9; this pattern will return any number between 0-999
# NOTE: even though IPv4 addresses octets are always between 1-255, using the simpler pattern employed here will also accomplish the goal of retrieving all IP addresses
# \. = escapes interpreting the `.` as part of the pattern command; instead the `.` is treated as a literal and searched for
# {3} = commands that the previous "capturing group" ([0-9]{1,3}\.) will repeat 3 times as part of the sought pattern
# [0-9]{1,3} - match a 1, 2, or 3 digit number; each digit may be between 0-9; this pattern will return any number between 0-999; this is for the 4th octet in the IP address
# \b= closing word boundary anchor; ensures the match is on a FULL IP address
